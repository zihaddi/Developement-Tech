                                                                    Event Management (Decoupled Logic)

Why Use Events?
Keeps code clean (e.g., donâ€™t put email logic inside a controller).
Scalable (add more listeners without modifying the original event).

Step-by-Step Event Flow
Define an Event (e.g., OrderPlaced)


php artisan make:event OrderPlaced
Create Listeners (Actions to Perform)


php artisan make:listener SendOrderConfirmationEmail --event=OrderPlaced
    Register in EventServiceProvider
    
    protected $listen = [
        OrderPlaced::class => [
            SendOrderConfirmationEmail::class,
            UpdateInventory::class,
        ],
    ];


Dispatch the Event

    event(new OrderPlaced($order));

Listeners Execute
    Send email, update stock, log analytics, etc.
